This git resource is to apply downloading satellite images into patches according to featureCollection (points).

In addition, this result will be stored into Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
Before, this will convert as cloud optimized geotiff. 

Lastly, exports2A.py, exports2A_v2.py and exports2A_v3.py are files to download satellite images.

We suggest to use exports2A_v3.py. This has to modify the script to download lables.

Thank you!!!
